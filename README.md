# Online Library


## Introduction
This online library system addresses issues related to quantity (limited space and books), quality (outdated and limited genres), and returning (overdue and damaged books). Additionally, it provides a solution for the lack of public libraries in my city, offering students a way to explore a vast expanse of knowledge online.

## Project Motivation
This project was initiated to address several key limitations of the school library:
- **Quantity**: The physical library could only accommodate thirty individuals at a time and housed a limited collection of just one hundred books.
- **Quality**: The genres available lacked variety and consisted of outdated books.
- **Returning Issues**: Problems with students surpassing borrowing durations and returning damaged copies were common.
- **Lack of Public Libraries**: The absence of public libraries in my city limited students' access to diverse learning resources.

## Development Background
In the summer of 2023, after completing my grade 12 board exams and with a roadmap in hand for the forthcoming years, I began developing the OL algorithm using the Java programming language. This project is a key milestone towards my goal of participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025.

## Features
- **Displaying Available Books**: Users can browse and search for available books in the library.
- **Issuing Requested Books**: Books can be issued to users based on their requests.
- **Adding Returned Books**: Returned books are added back to the collection.
- **Adding New Books to the Library's Collection**: We can add new editions of books to the library.
- **24/7 Accessibility**: The library is accessible at all times, providing constant availability.
- **Diverse Resources**: Includes audiobooks, blogs, and videos to cater to different learning styles.
- **Study Materials**: Offers a wide array of study materials to help teachers and students.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to help teachers create better test papers and allow students to prepare for national level examinations.

## Project Status
This project is currently in progress and all the features are not added yet.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (planned for future integration)
- **Backend**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL (or other relational database, planned for future integration)

## Future Plans
- Integration with a frontend framework (React, Angular, or Vue.js)
- Enhanced user authentication and authorization
- Advanced search and filter options
- Mobile responsiveness
- Deployment on a cloud platform
